```

## Overview

This project is part of the e-commerce suit of repos.

- **[shop-ui](https://github.com/cabezonidas/shop-ui "e-commerce ui")**
- [shop-admin](https://github.com/cabezonidas/shop-admin "e-commerce admin")
- [shop-public](https://github.com/cabezonidas/shop-public "e-commerce public")
- [shop-server](https://github.com/cabezonidas/shop-server "e-commerce server")

This package isn't necessarily lightweight because it uses many other dependencies to enforce same treatment of date manipulation, i18n, a11y, styling and animations in a consistent manner. The React apps that use this package see it as a framework that provides all that.

These can be found at the public websites of **shop-admin** and **shop-public** repos:
